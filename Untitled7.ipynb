       "\"\\n\\n Some tips for you! \\n\\nHi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)\\n\\nFirst of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.\\n\\nSecond, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.\\n\\nFor your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().\\n\\nHere's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.\\n\\nHopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.
